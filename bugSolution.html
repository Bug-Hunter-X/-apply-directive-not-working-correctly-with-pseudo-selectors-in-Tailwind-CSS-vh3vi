The solution is to apply the styles directly to the element instead of using the `@apply` directive:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This approach ensures that the pseudo-selector styles are applied correctly.  Avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors to prevent this issue.
