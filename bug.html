This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that has a pseudo-selector, such as `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`. When the utility class is applied using `@apply`, the pseudo-selector does not work as intended and the styles are not applied correctly.

For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click Me
</button>
```

In this case, the button will not change background color on hover. This issue can also occur when using nested `@apply` directives or when using the `@apply` directive with complex utility classes.
